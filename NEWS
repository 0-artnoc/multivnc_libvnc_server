Upcoming 0.5 release!

The library just got autoconf && automake support as well as a real install
target!

x11vnc was much improved thanks to Karl Runge!

CursorPosUpdate encoding supported thanks to Const Kaplinsky!

ZRLE encoding, if you have a c++ compiler!

HTTP now optionally handles HTTP proxy functions to connect to the same
server only.

Of course, a lot of bugs fixed since last release...
