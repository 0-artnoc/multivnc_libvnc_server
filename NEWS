Question: Why the *&!"/(§ did you change so many things in the API?
Answer: It was necessary to make this library slightly less
	painful to use with other libraries.

	Anyway, most changes are just search-and-replace:

	#include "rfb.h"  ->  #include <rfb/rfb.h>
	CARD8   ->  uint8_t
	CARD16  ->  uint16_t
	CARD32  ->  uint32_t
	Pixel  -> rfbPixel
	KeySym  -> rfbKeySym
	Bool  ->  rfbBool

	also, rfbUsage doesn't exit any longer, but returns FALSE

	If you used some constants defined in rfbconfig.h, you now
	have to prefix LIBVNCSERVER_ to the constants.
	
Upcoming 0.6 release!

lots of bugs fixed.


Version 5.0:

The library just got autoconf && automake support as well as a real install
target!

x11vnc was much improved thanks to Karl Runge!

CursorPosUpdate encoding supported thanks to Const Kaplinsky!

ZRLE encoding, if you have a c++ compiler!

HTTP now optionally handles HTTP proxy functions to connect to the same
server only.

Of course, a lot of bugs fixed since last release...
