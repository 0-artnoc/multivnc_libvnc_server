LibVNCServer: a library for easy implementation of a RDP/VNC server.
Copyright (C) 2001 Johannes E. Schindelin

What is it?
-----------

VNC is set of programs using the RFB (Remote Frame Buffer) protocol. They
are designed to "export" a frame buffer via net. It is already in wide use
for administration, but it is not that easy to make a server yourself.

This has been changed by LibVNCServer.

There are two examples included:
 - example, a shared scribble sheet
 - pnmshow, a program to show PNMs (pictures) over the net.

The examples are not too well documented, but easy straight forward and a
good starting point.

How to use
----------

To make a server, you just have to initialise a server structure using the
function rfbDefaultScreenInit, like
  rfbScreenInfoPtr rfbScreen =
    rfbDefaultScreenInit(argc,argv,maxx,maxy,8,3,bpp);

You then can set hooks and io functions (see below).

You can use a blocking event loop, a background (pthread based) event loop,
or implement your own using the processEvents function.

Also, there is functionality included to draw a cursor (see below).

To start also an HTTP server (running on port 5800+display_number), you have
to set rfbScreen->httpdDir to a directory containing vncviewer.jar and
index.vnc (like the included "classes" directory).

Cursor handling
---------------

The rfbCursor structure consists mainly of a mask and a source. The mask
describes, which pixels are drawn for the cursor (a cursor needn't be
rectangular). The source describes, which colour those pixels should have.

The standard is an XCursor: a cursor with a foreground and a background
colour (stored in backRed and similar with a range from 0-0xffff). The
arrays "mask" and "source" consist of byte padded rows in MSB order (i.e. a
10x4 cursor's mask has 2x4 bytes, because 2 bytes are needed to hold 10 bits).

It is very easy to make a cursor like this:

char* cur="    "
          " xx "
	  " x  "
	  "    ";
char* mask="xxxx"
           "xxxx"
	   "xxxx"
	   "xxx ";
rfbCursorPtr c=rfbMakeXCursor(4,4,cur,mask);

You can even set "mask" to NULL in this call and LibVNCServer will calculate
a mask for you.

There is also an array named "richSource" for colourful cursors. They have
the same format as the frameBuffer.

History
-------

LibVNCServer is based on Tridia VNC and OSXvnc, which in turn are based on
the original code from ORL/AT&T.
