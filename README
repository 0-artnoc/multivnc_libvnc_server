LibVNCServer: a library for easy implementation of a RDP/VNC server.
Copyright (C) 2001 Johannes E. Schindelin

There are two examples included:
 - example, a shared scribble sheet
 - pnmshow, a program to show PNMs (pictures) over the net.

The examples are not too well documented, but easy straight forward and a
good starting point.

How to use
----------

To make a server, you just have to initialise a server structure using the
function rfbDefaultScreenInit.

You then can set hooks and io functions.

You can use a blocking event loop, a background (pthread based) event loop,
or implement your own using the processEvents function.

History
-------

LibVNCServer is based on Tridia VNC and OSXvnc, which in turn are based on
the original code from ORL/AT&T.
