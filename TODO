immediate:
----------

Implement ZYWRLE decoding in libvncclient
make SDLvncviewer more versatile (test for missing keys, introduce scrollbars,
	make scrollable with 2xCtrl and mouse drag)
	- Tab does not work
	- Left Ctrl + A does not work
	- 2nd and 3rd mouse button are switched
Clean up ZRLE (probably not thread-safe: zrleBeforeBuf, zrlePaletteHelper)
style fixes: use Linux' coding guidelines & ANSIfy tightvnc-filetransfer:
	discuss on list
LibVNCClient cleanup: prefix with "rfbClient", and make sure it does
	not deliberately die() or exit() anywhere!
java vncviewer doesn't do colour cursors?
MinGW32 doesn't do fcntl on sockets; use setsockopt instead...
make corre work again (libvncclient or libvncserver?)
teach SDLvncviewer about capitals...
teach SDLvncviewer about CopyRect...
implement "-record" in libvncclient

later:
------

selectbox: scroll bars
authentification schemes (secure vnc)
	IO function ptr exists; now explain how to tunnel and implement a
	client address restriction scheme.
using Hermes library for fast colour translations.
