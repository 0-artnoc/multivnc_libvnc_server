immediate:
----------

fix bug in http (java) client with big endian server: byte swapping is broken
really support pthreads.
	- cursor drawing!
update to newest TridiaVNC version.

in the works:
-------------

adapt rdp2vnc (rdesktop)
optionally dont draw rich cursors as xcursors

later:
------

cursor "smears" sometimes when not using cursor encoding
	(seems to be gone now; haven't debugged properly, though)
udp
autoconf? at least Sun Solaris compilation
rfbConnect, ConnectToTcpAddr
CORBA
documentation

done:
-----

.translate.c: warning about non 8-bit colourmaps
	16-bit colourmaps are 192k -> no use without fast net.
.rfbCloseClient
.set colourmap
.support 3 bytes per pixel
.cursors
.cutpaste
.httpd
.other encodings
.test drawing of cursors when not using xcursor or rich cursor encoding
fix bug with odd width (depends on client depth: width has to be multiple of server.bytesPerPixel/client.bytesPerPixel). only raw!! -> bug of vncviewer!
.use sraRegion from Wez instead of miregion, because it is much smaller
.	- connection gone and then reconnect is a problem
	  the reason: there are in fact three threads accessing
	  the clientPtr: input, output and the application thread.
	  if you kill the viewer or do rfbCloseClient, all of those
	  three have to be warned that this is happening.
	-> rfbClientConnectionGone can only be called by the outer loop
	(with background loop, it is input, else it is processEvents).
