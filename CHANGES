   flag backgroundLoop in rfbScreenInfo
   rfbCopyRect & rfbCopyRegion (really copies rectangle in frameBuffer)
   added flag to optionally not send XCursor updates.
   fixed java viewer on server side:
	SendCursorUpdate would send data even before the client pixel format
	was set.
   fixed two pthread issues:
	rfbSendFramebuffer was sent by a ProcessClientMessage function
	(unprotected by updateMutex).
	cursor coordinates were set without protection by cursorMutex
   source is now equivalent to TridiaVNC 1.2.1
   pthreads now work (use iterators!)
   cursors are supported (rfbSetCursor automatically undraws cursor)
   support for 3 bytes/pixel (slow!)
   server side colourmap support
   fixed rfbCloseClient not to close the connection (pthreads!)
	this is done lazily (and with proper signalling).
   cleaned up mac.c (from original OSXvnc); now compiles (untested!)
   compiles cleanly on Linux, IRIX, BSD, Apple (Darwin)
   fixed prototypes
0.1
   rewrote API to use pseudo-methods instead of required functions.
   lots of clean up.
   Example can show symbols now.
