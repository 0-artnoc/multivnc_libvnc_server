0.2
   source is now equivalent to TridiaVNC 1.2.1
   pthreads now work (use the iterators!)
   cursors are supported (rfbSetCursor automatically undraws cursor)
   support for 3 bytes/pixel (slow!)
   server side colourmap support
   fixed rfbCloseClient not to close the connection (pthreads!)
	this is done lazily (and with proper signalling).
   cleaned up mac.c (from original OSXvnc); now compiles (untested!)
   compiles cleanly on Linux, IRIX, BSD, Apple (Darwin)
   fixed prototypes
0.1
   rewrote API to use pseudo-methods instead of required functions.
   lots of clean up.
   Example can show symbols now.
   All encodings
   HTTP
